# Pokemon
allows you to open pokemon showdown without needing to pin the game to your task bar.

since pokemon showdown does not install desktop shortcut and is very hard to find via pc search, i created this code to access pokekomshowdown.exe directly from the file depository
you may need to edit the pc file directory however the code will work for any other game you may want to open.
